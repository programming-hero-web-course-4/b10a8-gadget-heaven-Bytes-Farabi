## React Fundamentals Used

This project was built using several core React concepts, including:

- **Components**: The project is structured with reusable, modular components.
- **Props**: Data is passed between components through props for dynamic rendering.
- **State Management**: `useState` is used to manage local component states.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: `useEffect` is used for handling side effects, such as fetching and updating data.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is implemented for seamless client-side routing and navigation between pages.

## Data Handling and Management

For managing and persisting data across components, the project uses:

- **Local Storage**: Data such as cart items and wishlist items are saved in local storage, allowing the data to persist even after page reloads.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. **Product Listing and Details**: Users can view a list of products with details for each item, including images, descriptions, and prices.

3. **Cart and Wishlist Management**: Users can add items to their cart or wishlist, with data stored in local storage for persistence on page reload.

4. **Toggle between Login and Signup Forms**: A beautiful toggle system between login and signup forms, allowing users to easily switch between account creation and sign-in.

5. **Dynamic Navbar Cart Badge**: The cart icon in the navbar displays a badge with the current number of items in the cart, updating dynamically when items are added or removed.
